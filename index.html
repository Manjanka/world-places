                                <p>The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world, after the Nile.  The river has the largest drainage basin in the world and covers about 30% of South America. The Amazon got its name from the brave women warriors of the Greek mythology who were known by the name of Amazons. The Spanish soldier, Francisco de Orellana, who was first European to explore the Amazon, in 1541, gave the river its name after reporting pitched battles with tribes of female warriors, whom he likened to the Amazons of Greek mythology. The river originates from the Andes mountains in the Peru and flows from west to east, traversing through Colombia and Brazil, before draining into the Atlantic Ocean. The Amazon rainforests are the largest ecosystem of the world and are home to a wide variety of flora and fauna. The Amazon is the widest river of the world. The width of the river varies between 1.6 km and 10 km at low stage but expands to 48 km during rainy season. Before entering the Atlantic Ocean, the river acquires the shape of a broad estuary about 325 kilometres wide. Due to its vast size, the Amazon is also called as The River Sea.</p>

                                <p>Cappadocia, Turkey is the historic area of central Anatolia bounded by the towns of Hacıbektaş, Aksaray, Niğde and Kayseri (map). It was known as Cappadocia in ancient times, and is still called Kapadokya informally today.</p>
                                <p>Cappadocia is Turkey's most visually striking region, especially the "moonscape" area around the towns of Ürgüp, Göreme, Uçhisar, Avanos and Mustafapaşa (Sinasos), where erosion has formed caves, clefts, pinnacles, "fairy chimneys" and sensuous folds in the soft volcanic rock.</p>
                                <p>Although the volcanic landscape can appear inhospitable, the mineral-rich soil is excellent for growing vegetables and fruits, making Cappadocia a rich agricultural region. It has always been one of Anatolia's prime grape-growing areas, and still boasts many productive vineyards and wineries.</p>
                                <p>The Bible's New Testament tells of Cappadocia, but in fact this part of central Anatolia has been important since Hittite times, long before the time of Jesus.</p>

                                <p>One of the most interesting archaeological sites in Greece, Delphi is located on the slopes of Mount Parnassus in central Greece. Delphi Greece was the most important oracle in the ancient Greek world and pilgrims from all over the Mediterranean would come to ask for the prophecy of god Apollo. The prophecy was spoken by the god through the words of Pythia, the high-priestess of his temple. As the myth says and scientists have confirmed, Delphi is the naval of the Earth, meaning the central point of our planet. Along time, it became also the base of a political and military association, apart from a religious sanctuary. Source: www.greeka.com</p>

                                <p>Mount Everest (Tibetian: Chomolungma; Nepali: Sagarmāthā) is the largest and highest mountain on Earth . Mount Everest is in the Himalayas. It is about 8,848 metres (29,029 ft) high.</p>
                                <p>Its peak is on the border of Nepal and China. It is above the Death Zone where the air is too thin for a human being to live, so usually extra oxygen is used when climbing. The Death Zone refers to the parts of Mount Everest that are above 7,600 metres (24,900 ft) above sea level.</p>
                                <p>Two other mountains also can be named as "highest" mountains - the volcano Mauna Kea on Hawaii island is the highest mountain measured from the base underwater to the summit (more than 11 kilometres), and the summit of Chimborazo is the fixed point on Earth which is the greatest distance from the center. This is because of the shape of the Earth: the circumference around the Equator is greater than around the poles.</p>

                                <p>The Grand Canyon is 277 miles (446 km) long, up to 18 miles (29 km) wide and is over a mile (1.83 km) (6000 feet) deep in places. Nearly two billion years of the Earth's geological history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the Colorado Plateau was uplifted by tectonic action.
                                <p>Evidence suggests the Colorado River established its course through the canyon at least 17 million years ago. Since that time, the Colorado River continued to erode and form the canyon to the point we see it at today.</p>

                                <p>Machu Picchu is a pre-Columbian 15th-century Inca site in Peru, in South America.</p>
                                <p>The Incas built the city on a mountain ridge, 2430m above sea level. They lived there between 1200 and 1450 AD. Other people lived there before about 650 AD.</p>
                                <p>The Incas built houses, fields and temples by cutting the rock on the mountain so it was flat. They built an observatory to look at the stars.</p>
                                <p>When the Spanish invaded Peru, the Incas left Machu Picchu. Nobody knows for sure why they did that, but some think it was because they were scared of the Spanish. The city was left unfinished, most likely due to the Spanish invasion and/or a civil war between the ruling rival Inca brothers named Huascar and Atahualpa. The Spanish never found Machu Picchu or the lost city during their occupation.</p>
                                <p>Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historical Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide Internet poll.</p>

It was the tallest building in the world for over 3,800 years. The pyramid was built for Khufu, an Egyptian pharaoh. It was perhaps built by Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu. It is believed that it took about 20 years to build, and was completed around 2570 BC.</p>

                                <p>Kilimanjaro (or Kilima Njaro, which means "shining mountain" in Swahili), formerly Kaiser-Wilhelm-Spitze, is a mountain in northeastern Tanzania. Kilimanjaro is the tallest free-standing mountain rise in the world, rising 4600 meters (15,000 ft) from the base, and includes the highest peak in Africa at 5,895 meters (19,340 ft).[1] It gives a dramatic view from the surrounding plains. Almost 85 % of the ice cover on Kilimanjaro disappeared from October 1912 to June 2011.</p>
                                <p>Kilimanjaro is also a strato-like volcano. It has explosive eruptions. The last major eruption was about 100,000 years ago.</p>
